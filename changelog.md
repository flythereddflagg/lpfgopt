# Features To Be Added/Future Plans:

- Merging of master and lite branches
- Root finder
- A graphical user interface (GUI) that allows human-readable implementations of objective functions to be interpreted and optimized with graphical output. (this would optionally include a plot of the surface with the sample points plotted thereon.)
- Discrete and constrained optimization in C
- Large `struct` to mimic the class structure (or a C++ implementation)
- Re-release of the DLL and other shared libraries

# Changes in version 0.9.2

- Implementation in Python 3 (restructuring/simplifying the package and documentation)
- Discrete optimization (i.e. integer optimization)
- Constrained optimization
- Manual seeding of the randomizer
- Initial point set may be specified
- Compatibility with `scipy.optimize.minimize`
- 30 nose tests (with 26/30 successful with a single random seed)

# Changes to lite version 0.7.2:

 - Reorganize code to appropriate folders
 - Update README.md with installation instructions
 - Changing where the shared libs are installed

# Changes to version 0.6.2:
 - detailed documentation in source script
 - args
 - imports specified
 - numpy additions
 - private functions
 - implimentation and integration with C
 - MIT Licence
